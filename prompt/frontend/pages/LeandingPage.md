### Landing Page Prompt  

"Design a visually stunning and interactive landing page for an educational app. The page should include the following sections and features:

---

#### **1. Header Section:**  
- A fixed, responsive header with a transparent background that changes to a solid color on scroll.  
- Include the app’s logo on the left and navigation links (e.g., Home, Features, About, Contact).  
- Add a *"Sign Up"* button styled with a gradient (e.g., blue-to-teal).  
- Smooth scroll animation when clicking on navigation links.  

#### **2. Hero Section:**  
- A fullscreen hero banner with a parallax scrolling effect.  
- Include a dynamic tagline in large, bold typography (e.g., *"Revolutionize Your Learning Experience"*) and a subheading to describe the app’s value.  
- Add a central call-to-action button (e.g., *"Get Started"* or *"Explore Now"*).  
- Incorporate animations like:  
  - Floating or rotating elements (e.g., books, icons, or a globe).  
  - A looping animation showcasing app screenshots or a video walkthrough.  

#### **3. Features Overview Section:**  
- A grid layout to display 4–6 feature cards with modern hover effects (e.g., slight lift, shadow, or rotation).  
- Each card should include:  
  - An icon or image.  
  - A short title (e.g., *"Track Your Progress"*) and description (2–3 lines).  
  - A subtle button (e.g., *"Learn More"*) with hover scaling.  
- Use CSS animations like fade-in or slide-in as the user scrolls.  

#### **4. Call-to-Action Section (CTA):**  
- A full-width section with a bold background gradient (e.g., blue-to-purple).  
- Include a catchy headline (e.g., *"Ready to Take the Next Step?"*).  
- Add two contrasting buttons:  
  - Primary: *"Start Learning Today"* (blue with hover animation).  
  - Secondary: *"Contact Us"* (outlined with subtle scaling on hover).  
- Add a modern illustration or graphic related to education (e.g., a student on a laptop with animated charts).  

#### **5. Footer Section:**  
- A clean, responsive footer with:  
  - **Quick Links:** Navigation options like Home, Features, Blog, FAQ, etc.  
  - **Social Media Icons:** Interactive and animated on hover.  
  - **Newsletter Subscription Form:** Styled input field and button with a hover effect.  
  - Include app store badges for downloads (Apple App Store, Google Play).

  - Include **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI styling with modern design principles.
