#### **Color Combination Theory**  
1. **Primary Colors:**  
   - Use **blue** (trust, intelligence, calmness) as the primary theme color for the app.
   - Pair it with **white** or **off-white** for backgrounds to maintain simplicity and readability.  
   
2. **Accent Colors:**  
   - **Yellow** or **orange** for actionable elements like buttons and highlights (indicates optimism and energy).  
   - **Green** for progress bars, success indicators, and "Find Tutor" sections (associated with growth and balance).  

3. **Neutral Tones:**  
   - Use **light grey** for borders, dividers, or placeholders to create a subtle hierarchy.  
   - Incorporate **dark grey or black** for text to ensure high contrast and legibility.  

4. **Shades and Gradients:**  
   - Soft gradients from **blue to teal** for headers and banners (modern and inviting).  
   - Avoid overly vibrant colors that strain the eyes; focus on pastel shades for a calming effect.

#### **Typography**  
- Use **Sans-serif fonts** (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) for a modern and clean look.  
- Font sizes should ensure readability:
  - Headers: 24px–32px  
  - Subheaders: 18px–22px  
  - Body Text: 14px–16px  
  - Buttons: Bold 16px

#### **Interactive Animations**  
1. **Button Hover Effects:**  
   - Slight scaling or color change on hover (e.g., from blue to teal).  
2. **Card Animations:**  
   - Subtle zoom-in or slide-in animations when displaying student progress reports or course details.  
3. **Page Transitions:**  
   - Smooth fade-ins and sliding transitions between different sections or pages.

#### **Layout**  
1. **Header & Navigation Bar:**  
   - Sticky header with quick links to all features (Progress Report, Events, Find Tutor, etc.).  
   - Include a responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices.  

2. **Dashboard:**  
   - **Split into Sections:**  
     - Left panel for navigation (collapsible on mobile).  
     - Right panel for dynamic content (reports, events, etc.).  
   - Incorporate card-based layouts for "My Student Progress Report" and "My Courses."  

3. **Footer:**  
   - Include links to policies, contact information, and a subscription option for newsletters.

#### **Accessibility Features**  
1. **High Contrast Mode:**  
   - Provide a toggle for users with visual impairments to switch to a high-contrast theme.  
2. **Font Scaling:**  
   - Allow users to increase or decrease font size for better readability.  
3. **Keyboard Navigation:**  
   - Ensure the app is fully navigable via keyboard shortcuts.
